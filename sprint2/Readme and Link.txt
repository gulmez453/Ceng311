I have developed a simple and light cake order form. The form takes 
the information and gives a summary information that the order has 
been received on the new page.

The jQuery, jQuery UI widgets and functions used in the form are 
listed below.

I used a datapicker on the form that can be ordered in the future. 
I used jquery to change Kg when + and - keys are pressed. Also used 
a jquery to change the type of pie in the list inside dropbox by clicking 
on the text. I wrote a jquery that collects the form information and is 
used on the new page. I also wrote two functions that map and print the 
key-value on the new page. In addition, mail and name control is also 
carried out.

The Github link is as follows.
